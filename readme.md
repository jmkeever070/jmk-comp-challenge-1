# Dog Party 

This is my Static Comp 1 challenge web design.

# What is it?

This page is the second project for Turing MOD 1 students.

# What is the objective?

This is a project designed for students to continue to improve their basic HTML and CSS skills. The goals are as follows:

To have a responsive, basic static site with index.html and styles.css.
Site should work on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
Must use normalize in CSS instead of a reset file.
Flex-box was allowed for use on this project.

# How it was made

Created with a combination of HMTL and CSS

# Coding Style

Standard HTML and CSS

# Media Queries

I set media queries at at 715px and 546 px. At these sizes the articles will adjust their width to 30% and 50% respectively

# Challenges

I had some issues using flex-box for the layout until I started to understand how it works. Also
I had problems getting the content to stay within the article upon first resizing the window.
